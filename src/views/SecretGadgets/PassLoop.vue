              <h3>1. Trigger the cut-scene inside Cave</h3>To trigger this cut-scene, first, you need to unlock Vera (the Goddess) then have Doraemon, Sue, Sneech, and Big G at least â™¡â™¡.
              <br />If you have met the pre-requisites, then go to Cave at the West of Zazan Beach. You will trigger the scene where Noby find a white wall and think that thereâ€™s a treasure behind it.
              <br />You will leave the Cave with Doraemon and Sue, and meet with Cooper, Harmon, and Jemma outside. Sandy will come to scold them, then you need to help the trio to get along with Sandy.

          Most likely, you will trigger this event in Spring. Donâ€™t waste your time to go fishing and hoping to get Marlin. You wonâ€™t. Marlin is Summer-only fish. So you can forget this event for now.
          <br />Donâ€™t worry, anytime you trigger an event, that doesnâ€™t mean you have to finish it immediately. You can take your time.

          We recommend you doing this:
          <br />1.In the morning, immediately go to Zazan Beach / Zazan Cape. Bring your fishing rod with you (obviously, duh).
          <br />2.Save your game just before youâ€™re about to use your fishing rod.
          <br />3.Now just wait till LARGE FISH SHADOW appear. Donâ€™t bother to pull out your fishing rod if only small or medium sized fish shadow appear. Pull only when itâ€™s a large fish shadow.
          <br />4.If until 11:59 AM you still canâ€™t get Marlin, re-load your previous save file and do the step 3 again.

              After you got the fish, hand over the item to Cooper, not Sandy. This will trigger the rest of the scene and you will get the Pass Loop from Cooper later after the event.
              <br />
              <br />Now head back to the Cave, and inspect that white wall. This will trigger another event which will lead you to a quest to find the missing lithograph.
