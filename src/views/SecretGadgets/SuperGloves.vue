        >ðŸ“¢ Seems like early players can have free seeds by doing a quest from Gennie. When you talk to her during General Store open hours, scroll down and youâ€™ll see 2 items that cost 0. One is the quest to deliver that bag to Ryam, while the other is from Gennie. Buy the latter, then talk to Jemma several times afterward to get the seeds. Make sure your bag isnâ€™t full.</v-alert>
